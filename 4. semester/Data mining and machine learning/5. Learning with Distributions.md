# Part 1
## Keywords
* random variable associated with the event
	* random variable is not per say an actual variale. Its a function mapping the a sample space, or subset of a sample space, to a number.
* independent events based on random variables
* Expectation/mean

* variance
How much the random variable X (which again is a function, mapping a sample space to a number) differs from the expectation of X (look expecation).
[example](_DM566-2023-part5.pdf#page=25)
> notice that the expectation is multiplied on each summation.

* standard deviation
* covariance
	* how much one variable diverges from its expectation, times the other variable divergence from its expectation
* correlation

since we cannot tell anything, about x from y and vice versa, see the example on figures relevant to each possible coveriance
* median and mean


## Recap
* Random variable
* Expectation
* Variance


# part 2

## keywords
* Probability distrubutions
* probability in infinite sample space
	* infinitely many options => probability of random variable X taking 1 specific value, is 0.
* Cumulative distrubution function => integral of the function smaller than or equal to a.
	* can also do between a and b i.e $a\leq X\leq b$. Do the integral between.
* Joint distribution
* Uniform distribution
	* The area between a and b is summing up to 1, i.e the probability distribution sums up to 1 between theese, and is 0 elsewhere
		* Can also be used in multi-dimension,fx. the volume of a square in 3d just have to sum up to 1
* Normal distribution
	* If you have multiple random variables that may behave randomly, if we accumulate the sum of theese it will follow the normal distribution
	* Standard normal distribution
	* Geometrical meaning of mean and variance
		* The lower the variance the bigger the peak. because the sum of area on the graph still has to be the same 
	* Can be used in 3d aswel, the **Bivariate Normal Distribution** 
* Standarzing via **z-score**
