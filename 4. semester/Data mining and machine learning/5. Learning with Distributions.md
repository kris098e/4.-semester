# Keywords
* random variable associated with the event
	* random variable is not per say an actual variale. Its a function mapping the a sample space, or subset of a sample space, to a number.
* independent events based on random variables
* Expectation/mean

* variance
How much the random variable X (which again is a function, mapping a sample space to a number) differs from the expectation of X (look expecation).
[example](_DM566-2023-part5.pdf#page=25)
> notice that the expectation is multiplied on each summation.

* standard deviation
* covariance
	* how much one variable diverges from its expectation, times the other variable divergence from its expectation
* correlation

since we cannot tell anything, about x from y and vice versa, see the example on figures relevant to each possible coveriance
* median and mean
