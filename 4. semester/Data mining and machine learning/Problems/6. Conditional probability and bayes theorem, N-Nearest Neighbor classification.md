To solve these conditional probability questions, we can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

where P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both events A and B occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.

1.  Given that the selected individual purchased an extra battery, the probability that an optional card was also purchased can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) 
P(A|B) = 0.3 / 0.4 
P(A|B) = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that an optional card was also purchased given that the selected individual purchased an extra battery is 0.75.

2.  Given that the selected individual purchased a memory card, the probability that an optional extra battery was also purchased can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) 
P(B|A) = 0.3 / 0.6 
P(B|A) = 0.5

Therefore, the probability that an optional extra battery was also purchased given that the selected individual purchased a memory card is 0.5.

Remember when it is the _manhatten_ norm it will be a square around the point. So we can see that if we go one distance out we will only canst 1 cirlce. Go two distances out we will catch 3 more circles.

We can also calculate it by looking at the ![[_DM566-2023-part2.pdf#page=15]]
b.
1 distance: 1 circle
2 distance: 3 circle
3 distance: 3 squares
therefore the point will be a circle

c.
look the previous and we see it will be a square. since we only find squares when increasing the distance to 4 and 5.

**point is** it is generally not a good idea to have a big k for the k-nearest-neighbors, as we might classify the queries point to be some class that it should not be

Should get better results when using bigger training set when using kNN
