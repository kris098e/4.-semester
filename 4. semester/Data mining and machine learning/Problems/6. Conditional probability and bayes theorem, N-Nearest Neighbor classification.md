To solve these conditional probability questions, we can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

where P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both events A and B occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.

1.  Given that the selected individual purchased an extra battery, the probability that an optional card was also purchased can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) P(A|B) = 0.3 / 0.4 P(A|B) = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that an optional card was also purchased given that the selected individual purchased an extra battery is 0.75.

2.  Given that the selected individual purchased a memory card, the probability that an optional extra battery was also purchased can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) P(B|A) = 0.3 / 0.6 P(B|A) = 0.5

Therefore, the probability that an optional extra battery was also purchased given that the selected individual purchased a memory card is 0.5.

To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where P(A|B) is the probability of the individual having the disease given that the test result is positive, P(B|A) is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease, P(A) is the probability of the individual having the disease, and P(B) is the overall probability of a positive test result.

Given the information in the problem statement, we have:

P(A) = 1/1000 (1 in 1000 adults have the disease) 
P(B|A) = 0.99 (the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease) 
P(B|not A) = 0.02 (the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

$P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)$

where P(not A) is the probability of the individual not having the disease, which is equal to 1 - P(A).

P(B) = 0.99 * (1/1000) + 0.02 * (999/1000) P(B) = 0.02967

Now, we can plug in all the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) P(A|B) = 0.99 * (1/1000) / 0.02967 P(A|B) = 0.0333

Therefore, the probability that the individual has the disease given that the test result is positive is approximately 0.0333 or 3.33%.

Here is an example scenario where the Nearest Neighbor classification (k = 1) only gives incorrect classification results when using any of these points as query points and the rest as training examples, using Euclidean distance as the distance function:

Let the set of points in 2 dimensions be {(0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)}.

If we use any of these points as a query point and the rest as training examples, the Nearest Neighbor classification (k = 1) using Euclidean distance will give incorrect classification results.

For example, if we use the point (0,0) as the query point and the rest as training examples, the nearest neighbor of (0,0) will be (1,1) instead of (2,0), which is the correct classification based on the Euclidean distance.

Similarly, if we use (1,1), (2,0), or (2,2) as query points, the Nearest Neighbor classification (k = 1) will give incorrect classification results as well.

This happens because the points form a square where each point is equidistant from its two nearest neighbors. Therefore, the Nearest Neighbor classification (k = 1) will randomly choose one of the equidistant neighbors, leading to incorrect classification results.
