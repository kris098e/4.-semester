Discrete we use $E(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{max}*f(i)$
Continous: $E(X)=\int _{0}^{max} x *f(x) \, dx$

use $0*f(0)+1*f(1)+2*f(2)+3*f(3)+4*f(4)+5*f(5)+6*f(6)$
the expected number of notebooks sold 3.88

b.
$\frac{35}{9}*(325-250)-40\cdot\left( 6-\frac{35}{9} \right)=207.22$

calculate the baes optimal classifier for 1 
o1:

so for this one, o1, we choose class 2

Do these for all of the o's


# Decision Tree
#exercise_decision_tree 
Find the attribute with the lowest gini index to be the root

Use the formula on
[[_DM566-2023-part6.pdf#page=63]]

for Past Trend:
for positive: 4 up, 2 down
for negative: 0 up, 4 down

postive: $\frac{6}{10}$
negative: $\frac{4}{10}$
calculate for up: $1-\left( \frac{4^2}{6^2}+\frac{2^2}{6^2} \right)=0.45$
calculate for down: $1-\frac{0^2}{4^2}-\frac{4^2}{4^2}=0$

$G(split wind)=\frac{6}{10}\cdot 0.45+\frac{4}{10}\cdot 0=0.27$

split interest:
$\frac{4}{10}$ high, 2 up, 2 down
$\frac{6}{10}$low, 2 up, 4 low

trading volume:
G high: 0.49
G low: 0
G split trading volume: 0.34

Split on past trend is lowest. Then we continue with each branch, and remember to exclude the past trend which is not in this branch. I.e if we chose positive, we exclude all the rows which has negative

**calculate for positive**
