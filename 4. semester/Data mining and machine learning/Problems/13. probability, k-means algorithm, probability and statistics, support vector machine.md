Bc is B's compliment.
a. Think about it we need intersection of $T\cap B$ & $T\cap B^c$,  and do the probability of both and take their sum, to get the probability of whole T.

b. $Pr(B|T)=\frac{Pr(T|B)*Pr(B)}{Pr(T)}=\frac{0.99*0.02}{0.0198}=1$
c.

x1 & x2 is the first point, and y1 & y2 is the 2nd point
i.e the first calculation for the first point and first centroid is $(|4-0|, |0-2|)$

#CDF comulative density function   
CDF: **Cumulative Distribution Function**, returns the probability of a value less than or equal to a given outcome. PPF: Percent-Point Function, returns a discrete value that is less than or equal to the given probability.

#PDF probability density function
Probability density functions are **a statistical measure used to gauge the likely outcome of a discrete value** (e.g., the price of a stock or ETF). PDFs are plotted on a graph typically resembling a bell curve, with the probability of the outcomes lying below the curve.

B is just the derivative of CDF. Where r is considered a constant value.

$E(x)=\int x*f(x) \, dx$ so in c we use the function we have already gotten in B.

a. probability of it being within the area of the circle which is created when drawing a circle from the center to the X divided by the whole x. This is since it has to be less than or equal to the random variable. If we dont hit the target, i.e X is more than r, then the CDF is 1.

a. the support vectors are the closest to hyperplane/line. The points which are exactly on the margin. Want a bigger margin to be more sure of which class it belongs to. So we have 4 support vectors
b. Want to find the best hyperplane. This means choosing the line that has the highest distance from all of the support vectors.
c.
