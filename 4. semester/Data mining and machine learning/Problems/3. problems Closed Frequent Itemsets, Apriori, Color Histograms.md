a. will look like this (without the counts)

b. the ones where the the set is frequent, with respect to some support, and none of its supersets has the same support as this set (which also implies it is lower)

c. Find support from  the subset of the Closed Frequent Itemset, if it is not a CFI (the subset of size k-1) then it must have the same support as ats superset with size k, as the superset has the same support, since it is not a closed frequent itemsset.

Get solution, easy algorithm to understand

The distance-formulas wothout the weighted matrix, is fairly easy to understand, the harder part is the one with the matricies. 
* With $M_{1}$:

and $M_{2}$ is calculated the same way.

a. 
q: (red, orange, blue) = (1, 8, 7)
a: (red, orange, blue) = (1, 4, 4)
b: (red, orange, blue) = (8, 1, 7)
c: (red, orange, blue) = (2, 4, 9)
d: (red, orange, blue) = (1, 2, 13)

b.

c. use weighted matrix, to make orange and red more similar.
