using the formula [[_DM566-2023-part4.pdf#page=64]]
and then look at the example here [[_DM566-2023-part4.pdf#page=65]]

1. (+)=$\sum pr(+|h_{i})pr(h_{1}|D)=(0.6*0.5)+(0.2*0.3)+(0.9*0.2)=0.54$
2. (+) 68%, (-) 32%
3. (+) 48%, (-) 52%

a. the probability of `ski = yes` is $\frac{1}{2}$ since there are 4 yes out of 8 **SINCE WE HAVE DATA** if we had no data, the question would be a matter of how many options ski has, which would be either `no` or `yes`.

b.
weather (fx. take all the times it is sunny and use this as the lower part of the equation.):
1. pr(ski=yes|sunny)=$\frac{1}{2}=0.5$
2. pr(ski=no|sunny)=$\frac{1}{2}=0.5$
3. pr(ski=yes|rainy)=$\frac{1}{3}$
4. pr(ski=no|rainy)=$\frac{2}{3}$
5. pr(ski=yes|snow)=$\frac{2}{3}$
6. pr(ski=no|snow)=$\frac{1}{3}$

ski
1. pr(sunny|ski=yes)=$\frac{1}{4}$
2. pr(sunny|ski=no)=$\frac{1}{4}$
3. pr()

$$
f(x, \mu, \Sigma):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \pi)^d|\Sigma|}} \cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left((x-\mu) \Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)^{\top}\right)}
$$
here p will be sat in instead of x. This is just pairwise, so (2.5, 3.0) - the mean. We then just insert the matrix, and calculate fx in maple.
and the $\mid E \mid$ is the determinant.

This will give us the density, so we have to take product with how much of the overall points is in this cluster

so it is
$$
f(x, \mu, \Sigma):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2 \pi)^d|\Sigma|}} \cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left((x-\mu) \Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)^{\top}\right)} \cdot containment \ of \ points 
$$

so for A, insert the point p instead of x, insert the matrix and at last multiply by $30\%$

When we have calculated them all, just take the one with highest probability.
