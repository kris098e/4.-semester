1. reflexive
2. symmetric
3. not strict, as `r` can change
4. triangle i would assume
**pseudo-metric**

having fx and ID that doesnt have to be taken into account, or some other attributes.

**first record:** $\sqrt{ (0-1)^{2 +}(1-1)^{2} }=1$
**second record:** $\sqrt{ (1-2)^{2}+ (1-2)^2 }=\sqrt{ 2 }$
**3rd record:** $\sqrt{ (0-3)^{2} + (1-3)^2}=\sqrt{ 13 }$

first and second record are relitively similar

Look at the given solution for this. Its just calculating like this:

for 2, distances:
1. 2-2=0
2. $|2-4|=2$
3. $|2-6|=4$
we assign this to point to $u_{1}$

we go through all the others, and assign them the cluster they need to be in, from the distance. We then calculate the average of the points in the clusters as the new centroids, and calculate the distances again, assign the points to the closest cluster and again... until convergance

sillhuette coeficient is the mean of the values calculated.

# 4.5
`target` is the cluster centroids?

We can see that the amount of clusters is best for k-means++ when the thickness of the clusters more.
