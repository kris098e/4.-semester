Dense cluster: all of the points in the cluster are core points.

imbalance data set is when we have a lot more of some class compared to other classes. Fx 2 classes: 90% of one class and 10% of the other.
Becomes more balanced when we then decrease the one class with highest and increase the other.

K=#numbers **including** the point itself.
$V_{k}(x)$ is the volume. For the manhatten distance its $V_{k}(x)=2\cdot\epsilon$
n is the number of data points in the entire set.

for point E:
a. for k to be = 2 we have to go out to the distance of $\epsilon=4$, With this we get point F and D within. Therefore k = 3 $$f(x)=\frac{3}{20*2*4^2}=0.0046875$$
b. for k to be = 4 we need atleast epsilon = 5. We get C B D F G and itself. Therefore we have k = 6. Therefore the we have $$f(x)=\frac{6}{20*2*5^2}=0.006$$
c. and d. we only get point E for both of the cases. Therefore for epsilon = 1 we have
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{20*2*1^2}=0.025$$
and for epsilon = 2 we have
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{20*2*2^2}=0.00625$$

a. 
include the point itself

b.
Ties in neighbourhood is when if we increase the epsilon by 1 we get more than one point extra for the value of k. Therefore look at A fx. using epsilon=1 we get 2 extra points. Therefore there is a tie in the neighbourhood

a. Border points are points that are included by some other point, but it itself does not meet the criteria to not be a core point
[[_DM566-2023-part5.pdf#page=202]]
[[_DM566-2023-part5.pdf#page=244]]
There are no border points with minpts=2

**There cannot be any border points, Any point belonging to a cluster must be a core point, as it needs at least one other point in the neighborhood to connect.**


b. Deterministic means that if we start from any point in the data set, we will get the same result as if we started from another point.

**If a border point is density-reachable from two clusters, it is order- and implementation-dependant to which luster it will belong. However if a border point is assigned to all clusters simultaneously that can reach it, the result is dterministic again** This means we dont know which cluster the point belongs to, can be all/both

c. **Yes if border points are reassigned to some other cluster. See example 5 in the lecture. If E is assigned to the green cluster, the red cluster has only 4 elements, altough minPts=5**


d. Yes it checks for all the points that are in the set, see the examples.

e.  **Correct. Depending on the density-threshold, DBSCAN will mark either almost all or almost no object as a core point. (However, if you choose for example $x = min_{o\in D}\ 10-dist(o$) and minPts = 10, you can provoke to get some core points. The choise of such unsuitable parameters will become more difficult with increasing dataset size.)
For k-means, solutions on such datasets are (locally-) optimal if all clusters are approx. equally sized (at least if $k*d\ll n$). Solutions of several runs of k-means can be very difftent, though, which can be a hint at questionable solutions**

f. **The result would be the same for a cut through the single-linkage dendogram at distance epsilon**
find closest point for a point, do this for all that still needs a partner. Then cluster these partners. Pair until some epsilon is reached and these are then your clusters.

a.
formula for calculating the similarity of shared nearest neighbours is:
$$SNN_{5}(P,Q)=\mid NN_{5}(P)\cap NN_{5}(Q)\mid$$
fx. 
**Its ok to have more than 5 when increasing epsilon**
nearest neighbors for M: M N O P R
nearest neighbors for N: N O Q M P R

b.
Dense means that all of the points in the clusters are core points (i.e not noise or border points)
If SNN-similarity for the points in question is more than some threshold minPoint, then it is a core point.
**answer**: look at the table. The smallest value that we have in the table for the SNN-similarity is 2. Therefore we put this threshold to **2** (the similarity-threshold and epsilon is put to 2).
