Its a matter of calcuating the probability of being + or - given A, and then if this branch out X3 og X2. So if using the formula on the page provided above, we do the entropy of choosing A with the cases of + and -. And then minus the entroypy of the branches.

for x1 = A choose x3
for x2 = B choose x2.

#exercise_probability_random_variables

Its a matter of calculating which entries in x can sum up with something from y to meet the condition.

We have 6\*8=48,  options
a. {(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)} 
this probability will then be $\frac{3}{48}$

b. 
easier to calculate something that sums up to something that sums up to 5 and below. And then do $1-$ this value.
$$\frac{38}{48}$$
c. $$\frac{15}{48}$$
d. $$\frac{6}{48}$$
