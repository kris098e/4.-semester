# Keywords
* race condition
* Critical section (of a program) problem
	* peterson's solution (wiki proof is easier to understand than the book)
		* works for two processes
			* **mutual exclusion**
			* progress
			* Bounded waiting
	* Need assembly instructions that cannot be interrupted (atomic)
		* the other instructions are then build on top of theese.
* Memory barriers
* `test_and_set` and `compare_and_swap`-instructions
	* introduce locks
		* variation of compare_and_swap that introduce bounded waiting
* mutex lock
	* `acquire` and `release` the atomicly
	* queue of processes that wants to access the lock
* lock may be implemented with `spinlocks()` with while loop, busy doing nothing, but does many checks each second. Wasted CPU-time
	* can use this if the expected lock is held for a short time
		* else go to sleep (but pays context switch time)
* semaphores (low level synchronization, if want to implement synchronization, better off using higher level languages that already has implented something with locks and atomic)
	* signal and wait. signal increases the variable by 1, wait decreases by 1. Signals something is available, and the waiting graps the task and decrease the variable. If the variable is 0, no tasks are available
		* `block()` block yourself
		* `wakeup()` other process wakes you up
* monitors (not important to know about, just know it can be implemented with mutex locks and semaphores)
	* Condition variables
		* `wait()` doesnt behave as `wait()` in semaphores. 
			* may produce no side effects
		* signal and wait
		* signal and continue 
	* can be implemented with semaphores and mutex locks
* Liveness
	* are in a system state, no matter where we are in a system state, one event can always be triggered => live event
	* **quassi life** => if we can reach an event. Quassi life may not be live
