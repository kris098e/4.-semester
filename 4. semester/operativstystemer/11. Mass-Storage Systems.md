ctry to keep ssd on a load of less than 80% as then we need to erase more often (garbage collect), which is slow

magnetic tapes are cheap and reliable, compared to ssd and hard disks

Algorithms for how the arm should move around in the hard-disks

# Raid
fx have 8 discs, can use all at once for efficiency. Or use 1 and use rest for less data loss insurance. 
## Different levels
Raid 1,2,3 ... For how to use the additional discs for data loss  insurance. A failing desk can then just be swapped out with a working copy if fx using raid 1.

striping: using all disks for efficiency 

parity bits: xor between all the bits in the blocks, to know if some data-loss/data-flaws of bit flips, or lost memory.
