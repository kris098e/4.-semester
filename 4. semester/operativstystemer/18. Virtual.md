**dont really exist**

The VMM is seen as the system itself then.
VMMs that runs the virtual machines

## 2
runs in application

# VMs
DO NOT virtualize the kernel. Use the kernel on the hosting system

commands in the VM are just mapped to the hardware on the hosting machine, therefore it is fast

When switching to kernel-mode in the VM, we have an extra bit in the hardware for if we are in kernel mode in the hardware but in the VM

# Emulation

# Paravirtualization

# Unikernels
only takes whatever it needs to build a specific kernel, i.e slimmed down just so that i can only run and almost nothing more

using **kraft**
