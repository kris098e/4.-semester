# Keywords
* readers-writers problem
	* synchronization on some locks, and using `wait()` and `signal()` calls
		* some processes wants to write, some to read. 
			* how to synchronize?
		* same problem but with multiple readers, and a few times we have a write.
	* done with `mutex` and `semaphores`. See `page 292` in the course book
* Dining philosophers problem
	* deadlock example
		* handled via `wait()` and `signal()` calls, using **monitors** and belonging **condition variables** stored in an array for which we can signal the different condition-variables that are waited upon
* synchronization on windows
* Synchronization in linux
	* Methods for holding aqcuring locks fx `mutex_lock()` with `mutex_unlock()`
		also `preempt_disable()` with `preemt_enable()` in the kernel
	* can safely _preempt_ a kernel-process if it holds no locks, which can be seen by looking into some info the thread keeps 
* Posix
	* Mutex locks
	* semaphores
	* condition variables
	*
