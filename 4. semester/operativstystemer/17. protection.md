In the system itself. I.e in the OS


# Protection ring
different levels of protection for the system.

## Trust zones
Some hardware may need you to be in a different trust zone to speak with it. Fx the security chip contatining the private key maybe only the cpu can talk with this.

# capability and access control lists
[[ch17-2022.pdf#page=25]]
capability the permission is stored with the domain, in the other it lives with the file

**capability more secure** page 26

# Access Matrix
[[ch17-2022.pdf#page=16]]
What different domains can invoke on objects, i.e the printer can access obbject 2 with `read`

Not implemented in real systems, theoretical

## copy rights
[[ch17-2022.pdf#page=20]]
The one with the star can give permission to the other domains

## owner  rights
if a domain own it, it can give all other domains owner rights. Change an entire row

## modified access
[[ch17-2022.pdf#page=22]]
**control** can control everything another domain should be able to do, i.e change entire row

## access control list
have an access control list to each object, i.e which can access this object.  Fx in files, which groups and users can access til file

### capability storage
save the entire row, to see which objects this user can do

# Revocation of access rights
Different methods see page 32
