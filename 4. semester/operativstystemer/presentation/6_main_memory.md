- Many processes in memory
- Hardware
    - base + limit
- Address binding
    - compile time, load time, execution time
- logical physical
    - mapping (MMU, base+limit example)
- Dynamic loading, dynamic-linking
- Allocations methods
    - Contigous
        - protection (base+limit checking)
        - Memory allocation (varying block sizes, FF, BF, WF)
        - Fragmentation (compaction, paging)
    - Paging (drawing)
        - Page table (in memory)
        - TLB (caching, hardware)
- Huge memory structure
    - 32-bit logical address space
    - 4-KB page Size
    - Page table would have 1 million entries: $(2^{32} / 2^{12})$
    - Entry size / pointer size: 4 bytes
    - 4-MB page table (since 4 byte entries)
- Solution
    - Hierarchical Paging (10 | 10 | 12)
        - problem: 64 bit (32 | 10 | 10 | 12)
    - Hashed Page Tables (clashes)
        - modulo reduce page table size (store in use pages)
        - constant time lookup
    - Inverted Page Tables
        - Global store `<pID, page>` gives `<index>
        - Page size = Adress Size
- Swapping
    - (old) Swap process => (new)swap page
    - (mobile) terminate, power save
