- IBM 1972
- Hypervisor
  - Type 0 - Hardware
  - Type 1 - Like os
  - Type 2 - Operating-like software
- Implementation of VMMS
    - Paravirtualization 
    - Programming-environment virtualization (JVM)
    - Emulators (assembly instruction)
    - Application containment (Host kernel)
        - Solaris zones, linux containers, docker
- Docker
  - Dockerfile
  - Docker Image
  - Docker Container
- Benefits
    - snapshots, live migrations, freeze, clone, protection
    - Developing multiplatform
- Problems
    - Switch kernel mode => what does host do
    - Trap-and-emulate
        - Special instructions / Binary translation
- Hardware support
    - CPU extra bit for vkernel or not
    - CPU scheduling
    - Memory managment / page tables
    - I/O
    - Overcommitment
- Unikernels
    - Improve efficency and security
    - Bare minimum
        - Pack application with it
