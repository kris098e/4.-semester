- Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
    - Seek time: move arm (miliseconds)
    - Rotational latency: rotate disk (miliseconds)
    - Positioning time: Seek time + rotational latency
    - Fast (sequential)
- Nonvolatile memory (NVM)
    - Fast (Random access)
        - below 80% (due to errasing when writing)
            - garbage collector
    - Page wears out after ~100.000 errases
    - Bus bottlenect => connect to motherboard
- Magnetic tapes (reliable, slow, cheap)
- Compare prices 
- Disk Scheduling
    - FCFS (inneficient => can be LSTF)
    - SSTF (starvation)
    - SCAN (amost redundant half of the scan)
    - C-SCAN (wrap)
- NVM scheduling (write equally to each block)
- Storage device management (low level formatted, logical formatted)
- Swap-Space Management (low level formatted, raw blocks)
- RAID (mean time till data loss)
    - RAID 0 (Pure striping)
    - RAID 1 (Pure mirroring)
    - RAID 4 (Block-interleaved parity)
    - RAID 5 (Block-interleaved distributed parity)
    - Raid 0+1 (stripe then copy)
    - RAID 1+0 (write then mirror then continue the stripe)
- Storage attachment (fiber, network, cloud storage)
