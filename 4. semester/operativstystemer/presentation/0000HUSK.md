# KIG PÃ…
services provided by the operating system. 
**PCB** contains
**FCB** contains
# 02
**ONLY** kernel-threads can be scheduled on the CPU

## Presentation
Talk a bit faster and dont go so much into detail?

# 03
REMEMBER round robin!

talk less about the  real time scheduling, mention the algorithms and move on. **Really want to talk about the queues** and the **scheduling on multi processors**

### Last presentation went well.
# 04
Take care that you dont spend too much time on petersons solution
**write out test and set with the while loop**.
remember for dining philosipher that you check if both of the sidemates are eating, if not and you are hungry then you will be put to eating state, and your conditon variable is signaled which you are waiting on.
**The chopsticks are NOT the condition variables** it is the philosiphers which are the condition variables.

# 05
remember to mention the approaches to deadlocks.

**remember** bankers algorithm is for deadlock avoidance. 
Start of by drawing the resource allocation graph seeing that there is a deadlock. Make the bankers algoritm for this seeing that the system indeed was in an unsafe state. Introduce a new resource for one them and see we have a safe state. Use the variation of bankers to see deadlock if no two resources for one of the resources. 
**Remember** we only see based on the max and available that we will enter an unsafe state **if we allow a process to enter**. I.e we can mimic that a new process comes in **but it is not about if a process makes a request** since it is solely based on max, allocation and available. In the varation of bankers we see if we are in a deadlocked state.
Can mention the runtime and why resource allocation graphs cannot be used with multiple resources per resource type.

## Presentation
just draw the resource graph and make examples from it. Making a presentation where we have introduced a deadlock with 2 processes and single resource 2 types. Showing that we cannot detect or  see if we can allocate if using multiple types based on the graphs. However can use bankers algorithm and detection. Introduce the additional resource when going through it, and also take it away when we go through it.

# 06
Just begin talking about the allocation methods right away after explaining why we want to talk about main memory.

# 07
Remember to talk about **beladys anomaly**.  
Remember to talk about the global free frame pool or the local free frame pool. Remember also that you use for the allocation: priority, proportional, equal. Usually use global.

## Presentation
Took too long time. Use mention for example the second chance algorithm.

# 08
just start of with RAID. Start of by saying that disks fail and this is why we want to use RAID as it minimizes the mean time till data loss.

# 09
## presentation
went very well, remember to mention about the types of file systems, they just need to implement the operations on the files to be used correctly.

could also mention that **disk structure** usually contains a boot control block, volume control block

# 10
Went well.

# 011
Remember principle of least privilege. 
**Start the presentation with** "protection: inside of the operating system. This is basically a 'per object' or a 'per user/group' decision".

# 012
REMEMBER the 4 ways of implementing a VMM:
1. Paravirtualization
2. application containment
3. emulators
4. programming environment
