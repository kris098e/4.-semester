- CPU- and I/O bound processes
- preemptive and non-preemptive
    - process state switching
- dispatcher (save state, restore state)
- scheduling critereas (CPU utilization, wait time ...)
    - priority
    - starvation
- Algorithms
    - FCFS
    - SJF
        - Implementation not possible, predict
    - Round Robin
        - time quantum sice
- Multilevel queue & multilevel feedback queue
    - Example (different queues, time quantum, algorithm to use)
- Multi-processor schedualing (assymetric, symmetric)
    - examples:
        - Cache, Soft & hard affinity
        - NUMA architecture (scheduale on same NUMA node)
        - Heterogeneous multiprocessing (want slow or fast)
    - Hardware-threads
- Real-time schedualing (hard & soft)
    - event latency (interrupt latency + dispatch latency)
    - Schedualed in periods
        - Rate monotonic schedualing (preemptive, priority inverse of CPU time, optimal for static priorities)
            - bounded at 69% CPU util for inf processes, for 2 83%. I.e dont overcommit
        - Earliest Deadling First (preemptive, dynamic adjusted priorities) 
- Linux (preemptive, CFS, RR, virtual runtime (priority))
- Windows (preemptive, 32 level priority, )
- Both uses multilevel feedback queue with RR in some of the queues
