	- process state (fx waiting)
	- process number (pID)
	- program counter
	- registers
	- priority
	- pointers to page table
	- accounting information
	- I/O devices allocated, list of open files
- Operations on processes (creation, termination(why))
	- zombie, orphan
- process scheduling (I/O and CPU bound)
- threads
	- Draw single thread and multi thread
	- concurrency/parallelism, responsiveness, lightweight
