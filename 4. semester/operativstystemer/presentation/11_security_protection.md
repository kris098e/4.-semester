- Difference
- Hardware attacking
    - Read of memory
    - Exploit speculative instruction pipeline
- Shodan
- Security problem 
    - Threat (vulneribility)
    - Attack (attempt)
        - confidentiality, denial of service, theft of service...
        - man-in-the-middel, session hijacking...
        - Trojan horse, buffer overflow (`gets()`), ransomware...
        - Programming skills (script kiddies)
    - 4 levels
        - application, operating system, network, physical
            - attacks and prevention
- Cryptography
    - Symmetric & antisymmetric
    - RSA (fx used in TLS)
        - Confidentiality (encryption & decryption)
        - Message verification (hashes with encryption & decryption)
        - Polylogarithmic runtime
    - GPG-command
    - Key distribution (Certificate authorities)
- Protection Rings
    - Principle of least privilege
- Access lists & capbility list (drawing)
    - operations
    - access lists: centralized, single point of failure
    - capability lists: opposite, but harder to implement
        - Revocation of access rights
        - Groups
- Mandatory access control
    - DAC: can see file without permissions
    - MAC: can't see file without permissions
- Programming language support
    - fx java stack inspection
