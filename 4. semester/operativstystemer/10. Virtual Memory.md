# background 
As a restriction of a program is, that for it to run, it needs its entire logical address space in memory. However most processes does not need their entire program to be executing properly.
fx
* Error handling (most often not needed)
* Array lists, sets ... (often allocated more memory than needed)
* Certain operations may be used very rarely.

Would like to execute program which is not entirely in the main memory
benefits:
* Program is not limited by the amount of physical memory, can have larger virtual memory
* As filling up less memory per process, more processes can be in memory => increased CPU utilization
* Less I/O as each process does not load in its entire memory. Programs run faster.

When holes in the middle, it is known as a **Sparse address space** allowing for more flexibility, when the heap or stack needs to grow.

allow using of
* Shard libraries, which are read-only but are perceived by the processes to only be owned by them
* Shared memory, a process can create a shared memory segment and the other processes can talk with it like a shared paging, but with write access as well
* Pages can be shared between child and parent

# Demand Paging
Only load the pages when they are used. 
* As filling up less memory per process, more processes can be in memory => increased CPU utilization
* Less I/O as each process does not load in its entire memory. Programs run faster.


## Basic Concepts
Need hardware support, telling whether or not the page is in memory or not. If invalid it is either not in memory or it is not belonging to the address space of the process. When valid just access it.

When accessing invalid page => page fault is generated, trap is issued to the operating system.
the OS checks:
1. Check internal table (stored in PCB) to see if the memory access was valid or invalid 
2. If invalid, segmentation fault and terminate the process. If valid locate the page, and pull it in
3. Find free frame to store the page
4. Store information to the allocated frame
5. Modify page table such that it keeps information for the page and set the valid bit to valid
6. Restart the execution

**Pure-demand paging** is when a process is loaded into memory with no pages, and first when it executes its first instruction a page is put into memory, faulting and moving on to the next instruction.

**example** Instruction ADD A B into C. First fetch and decode instruction, fetch A then B, add together and store it into C. If C's page is not currently in memory, a page fault is generated, and the entire process of ADD must be made again. However page faults are rare, so the duplications happens rarely.
**extreme case** is fx when moving a 256 byte stream from one location another, where the moving is on overlapping pages, possibly page faulting in the middle of the transfer. More trouble happens if the source block has been modified during the moving. 
1. solution may be to check if the blocks which are moved to are in memory, and only then moving
2. solution may be to have temporary registers to hold the value, and if page fault occurs, rewrite the data.

This case serves to show that demand-paging may be hard to implement

## Free-Frame List
A list of all the free frames is kept intact by the OS
The frames are usually 0'd out before, since security risks may arise if not
At startup the entire memory are in the free-frame list. When the list empty, it must be repopulated

## Performance of Demand Paging
Can be calculated by
$probability\ of\ page\ in\ memory \cdot access\ time\ +  (1- probability\ of\ page\ in\ memory) \cdot page\ fault\ time$

The effective access time is directly proportional to the `page-fault rate`, since it is so fast to access a page in memory, and to retrieve the page from disc or 2nd'ary storage takes so long.
1. One solution is to copy the entire process' pages into a swap space since it is faster than going to disc, but this will also eliminate the logic of demand paging.
2. another solution is to demand-page the first page, and then when replace, write them to swap space. This will still ensure that pages which arent used at all are not put into memory or secondary storage

### Mobile systems
Uses demand paging but the disc is the backing store. Reclaim read-only pages if needing memory.

# Copy-on-Write
Page-share with a parent. Rapid startup of processes, limiting page faults
The shared pages are marked as `copy-on-write`. If either of the processes write, a copy of the shared page is created.

There exists an alternative version of `fort()` called `vfork()`, **virtual fork**, where when called the parent will wait for the child to terminate. I uses the same pages as the parent, and any modifications to these will be visible to the parent. Because no copying takes place, `vfork()` is extremely fast.

# Page Replacement
When we can have 10 frames in memory, but two processes which ultimately will max need 10 frames in memory, but only uses 5, we can have two processes in memory. This will increase the **degree of multiprogramming**, while overcommiting memory. 
>[!WARNING]
>I/O buffers can also be stored in memory, competing with the resources for regular processes in some systems. Others hold the information in a fixed storage for I/O buffers. This is **discussed in section 14.6**

If no free frames are available, the free-list is empty. What to do then?
1. terminate processes. Not the best choise, as the users should be not beware that the operating system is using demand-paging, and therefore the process should not just be eliminated. **But it still is a choice**
2. Swap out the pages to the swap space. However **most  modern operating system versions does not use swap spaces**
3. use `Page replacement`

## Basic Page Replacement
Find a page that is not currently being used, and free it. Done by writing its content to swap space, updating the effected page-tables that it is no longer in memory. Based on this, modify the page fault routine.
