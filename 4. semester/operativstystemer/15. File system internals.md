possibility mount file system onto a file system

See slides for figure of how it works

# nfs(4)
nfs is a protol which is implemented by many file systems

Used for mounting

protocol for how you mount a remote file system
## designed as stateless protocol
i.e remote does not know where in file you are. Only knows what bytes are in

### Not like this anymore
#### now implemented more for efficiency


## authentication and security 
uses none, its up to the user 
### nfs3
security at the level of just being on the right ip-address or in the correct range, then you can mount. 
Not done like this anymore.


# cifs
also used for mounting

# Auto mounting
mount  the file system only when entering the directory which is mounted onto the filesystem

# Distributed information systems

# Consistency semantics

## Unix semantics
fx writes to open file immediately visible to other with file open

## Session semantics
