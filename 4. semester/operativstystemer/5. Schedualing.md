* Shortest job first, try to compute the cpu burst for prediction
	* exponential averaging with variable $$\alpha$$ to manage how much the previous bust has of impact on the prediction

multiple priorities, different ques with different priorities and time slots. With multiprocessor systems (multi core), there are different schedualing algorithms such that processes are schedualed into a que for the different processes or all processes are in same que and assigned to a core. A process may want to be ran on the same CPU it has just ran on, as the cache may have something belonging to it. 
as processes has priority, this may result in **starvation** for some processes, and the solution is aging, where a processes priority increases the more time it has waited. 

# Keywords
* preemptive schedualing
* nonpreemptive schedualing (processes cannot be paused or taken of CPU, without the process itself calling for it)
* schedualing criterias
	* wait time (wait time for a process)
	* responsiveness (small enough time quantums)
	* ?
* priority schedualing (linux has 140 priority levels. Default is 120 _if seen on "top" 20=120_, can use "**nice -15**" to bump a priority to 120+15. can also do "sudo **nice --15**" then the process will get 120-15=105 as PR(priority))
	* starvation (if there are always processes with higher priority, then some processes wont get to execute)
	* aging (priority of process increases as it gets older)
* Symmetric multiprocessing: every cpu are the same
* asymmetric multiprocessing: one cpu controls what goes on the other cpus
* multilevel feedback ques
* NUMA (non uniform memory access, better to have the same process on the same CPU instead of migrating to other CPU, fewer migrations is better for execution time)
* CFS Completly Fair Schedualer

# real time schedualing
## Keywords
* soft real time schedualing (try their best to be real-time)
* hard real time schedualing (not seen implemented?)
* Rate monotonic schedualing 
	* sometimes doesnt work for load lower than 100% (see slides)
		* earlist deadline first schedualing can fix this 
* 

# book
* Cpu schedualer is the one deciding which process gets the next spot
* Dispatcher is the one context switching the contents on the cpu. I.e puts the new program block to the cpu to execute from
* preemtive, nonpreemtive schedualing
* schedualing
	* first come first served
	* shortest job first (nonpreemptive), shortest remaining job first (preemptive)
	* round robbin (time quantum and wrap arounds)
	*
