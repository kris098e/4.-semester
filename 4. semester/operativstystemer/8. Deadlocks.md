Bankers algorithm is a Deadlock avoidance algorithm 
![[ch08-2023.pdf]]

# processes uses resources (CPU, memory..)

# Four conditions
that has to be met for a deadlock to occur

some of the charachterizations implies the other. fx. circular wait implies hold and wait

# Resource-allocation graph
processes and resources
cycle can mean a deadlock. There is examples where a cycle doesnt mean a deadlock
If only one resource per resource-type, a cycle means deadlock

# Methods for handling deadlocks
ensure one of the 4 conditions are not met. However this is not realistic

fx. mutexes has to imply mutual exclusion. cannot just do such that it doesnt.

look slide
# Deadlock prevention
ensure all 4 conditions are not met

# Deadlock avoidance
Safe states and unsafe states, can be analyzed via bankers algorithm

# Bankers algorithm
see the explanation in slides
## data structures
### max
what is the worst case for how many resources this process will want to get.
### allocation
what is currently being allocated
### Available
how many resources are currently available.
### Need
what the process may need more before meeting the max scenario.
