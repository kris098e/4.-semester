##### Pioneers of programming
- Charles Babbage 1837 
	- Invented the Analytical Engine 
- Konrad Zuse 
	- Plankalkül (plan calculus) 1942-1945 
	- notation (never implemented) 
- Corrado Böhm (1951) 
	- First language with a compiler

##### Generation
There are 4 "generations" of programming languages 
1. machine code 
2. assembly 
3. high level languages (Fortran, C, Java, …) 
4. ad-hoc/visual (Visual Basic, SQL, ...)

##### Programming Styles
- Imperative (+ object oriented) 
- Functional 
- Logic / Declarative 
- Functional logic

#### Langueages

##### Fortran
- First effectively implemented high-level language by John W. Backus at IBM (1956) 
- Introduced variables, loops, procedures, statement labels and much more 
- Earliest versions of Fortran had many unique features, often awkward, later kept along for compatibility 
- Still widely used in engineering applications that require much array manipulation 
- Newest version 
	- Fortran 2018

##### Algol 60
- Design in 1960 by a group of people including John McCarthy, Alan J. Perlis, Peter Naur, ... 
- First to have block structure, recursion, and a formal definition 
- Not used now, but it is the ancestor of most contemporary languages 
- As far as design goes, Algol 60 was without doubt the most important innovation in the history of programming languages
- American VS European battle

##### Cobol
- Created by a consortium (1958) 
- Business-oriented computations 
	- very strict program organization 
	- poor control structures 
	- elaborate data structures, record type introduced for the first time 
- Used to be very popular in business and government, much less at universities 
- Still used → legacy applications

##### Basic
- The first in history language of personal computing (1964) 
- Designed to be easy to learn (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) 
- Very simple, limited, though still general-purpose 
- Present-day versions of Basic are full-fledged languages—not "basic", and not easy to learn any more.

##### Simula 67
- An extension of Algol 60 designed for simulation of concurrent processes 
- Introduced the central concepts of **object orientation**: classes and encapsulation 
- Predecessor of Smalltalk and C++ 
- Now unused

##### Pascal
- A conceptually simplified and cleaned-up successor (1970) of Algol 60 
- A good language for teaching structured programming 
- Its later extensions (for example, Delphi) are full-fledged systems programming packages

##### C
- The implementation language of Unix (1972) 
- A great tool for systems programming and a software development language on personal computers 
- Once fashionable, still in use, but usually superseded by C++ 
- Dangerous if not used properly: segmentation faults! 
- Relatively low-level

##### Lisp
- One of the earliest programming languages (John McCarthy - 1958) 
- Based on the concept of computing by evaluating **functions**. Very good for symbolic computing 
- For years, the only language for Artificial Intelligence (Prolog is 12 years younger) 
- Many dialects, two standards (Scheme, Common Lisp) 
- Lisp's successors are very elegant (Miranda, ML, **Haskell**)

##### Prolog
- A very high-level programming language (1972) 
- Declarative, based on a subset of **logic**, with proofs interpreted as computation 
- Very powerful: 
	- Non-deterministic (built-in backtracking) 
	- Elaborate, flexible pattern matching 
	- Associative memory 
- In skilled hands, it is a very strong tool

##### C++
- An *object-oriented* extension of the *imperative language* C, designed in 1980 
- This is a hybrid design, with object orientation added to a completely different base language

##### Java
- Sized-down reworking of C++ designed in 1995 
- Full object orientation 
- Designed for Internet programming, but general-purpose 
- Very used (in the top 5 of the most used languages) 
- To not be confused with JavaScript!

##### Scripting languages
- Text processing: 
	- Perl (1987) 
	- **Python** (1991) 
- Web programming 
	-  **JavaScript** (1995) 
	- PHP (1995)

##### "New" ones
- Golang (channels for concurrency) 
- Kotlin (type inference) 
- Rust (ownership system) 
- Typescript (optional static typing)
