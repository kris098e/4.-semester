```java
int x = 1;
int y = 2;
double z = x + y; // coercion, types are converted to another without us asking

double e = (double)x + (double) y; // term cast
```
coercion is implicit (i.e we dont have control of what happens)

## pros of coercion
simpler for the programmer, the compiler will most of the time just make it work

## pros of type casting
more control of the programmer, relys less on the compiler
