The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass, in order to override it.

Overloading, on the other hand, refers to the process of defining multiple methods in a class with the same name, but with different parameters. The methods can have different return types or different numbers and types of parameters. When a method is called, the appropriate version of the method is selected based on the number and types of arguments passed to it.
