# Keywords
* Static scope
	* static link to the block that contains this block to retrieve variables
		* (compiler) Associate how many times we have to follow static link to retrieve variable
	* Display (not used often as nesting is often not very deep)
		* Can access the element at the k'th level in constant 2 times, if we know that we need to access an element which k levels above this nested block. 
		* Works in the way that each time we enter a nesting a new pointer is created to this block. I.e the k'th entry in this table of pointers to the nesting, points to k'th nesting. However when we enter a new block in the same k'th nesting level, the pointer must then also be updated. 
		* The backtracking pointer is used since when popping of the activation record for this procedure, we then know which activation record should be activated again. 
			* When looking at the figure, see it as C calls D which calls E which then returns and C calls itself again?
	* 
* Dynamic scope
	* A-list (go through the list and match the first variable you want). Try looking at the example. Imagine that A calls B. The A-list would first have entries for x and y, then if it would need a y, then it could just go through the list.
	* CRT (central referencing table), better than A-list
		* reach the variable in constant time
			* Here you go through the list and take the first on you want, but it is hashed. so constant time
  
In dynamic scope implementation, a central referencing table (CRT) is used to keep track of the bindings of variables and their values in the current dynamic scope. The CRT is a data structure that is used to resolve references to variables at runtime.

Whenever a new dynamic scope is created, a new CRT is also created to keep track of the bindings in that scope. When a variable is referenced, the CRT is searched for the most recent binding of that variable. If a binding is found, the value associated with that binding is returned. If no binding is found in the CRT, the reference is resolved in the next outer scope until a binding is found.

When a new binding is created for a variable, it is added to the top of the CRT. When the current dynamic scope is exited, the top binding is removed from the CRT, and the reference to the variable is resolved in the next outer scope.

The use of a CRT in dynamic scope implementation allows for flexibility in variable scoping, as the binding of a variable can change based on the order in which the scopes are entered and exited at runtime. However, this flexibility can also lead to unexpected behavior if the programmer is not aware of how the CRT works.
