# Keywords
* abstraction of control (subprograms)
* Parameters
	* declaration: formal parameter `f(int n)` n is formal
	* user/call: actual parameter `f(3)` 3 is the actual parameter
* parameter passing
	* by value: copy the value, the formal parameter will then be a local variable. as it is a copy.
	* by reference: the actual value is passed (i.e the pointer), i.e can change the actual parameter given, and change something in the main/call program.
		* java will be doing by reference if it is an object as we dont want to deep copy an entire object. When using primative types it is by value.
		* In C the parameter is always passed by value, you can then pass a pointer.
		* **if passing by reference** we cannot call function `foo(1+3)` since it does not have any reference to anything but two variables which are not stored anywhere in the memory
	* by constant (or read-only)
	* by result (goes from subprogram to caller. Give a value to a variable given as actual parameter in the subprogram)
		* Value-result != reference
	* call by name/need (replacing the formal parameter usages with the actual parameter given, or the entire expression provided)
		* careful with blindly applying the substitution
			* or handle it another way
		* side effects
		* value-result != name
* Functions as procedure parameter
	* deep vs shallow binding
		* always the same for static scope
		* can change when using dynamic scope
	* Implement the scope via: Closures
		* have to know where the function code is in memory, i.e where to execute from, and a pointer to the environment, i.e the variables
* Functions as return values
	* Has to freeze variables that the function uses, i.e if the function references variables in activation record that goes away
		* activation record on the heap
*
