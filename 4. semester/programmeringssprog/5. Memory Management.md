# Keywords
* Static memory allocation
	* stack
		* activation records
			* static links
			* dynamic links (pointer to the previous activiation record?)
* dynamic memory allication
	* heap (stack is not enough, as we need variable sized data structures. Need bigger space, since stack has fixed length of mem for elements)
* Activation record (stack, dynamic linking, static linking)
	* Larger for procedures than for anonymous code blocks
	* also used for implementing static scoping and dynamic scoping
* Heap
	* Fixed size (list of blocks)
	* variable length  (still blocks, but has smaller and larger blocks)
		* Fragmentation
			* alignment for blocks / requirements
		* 1. first fit
		* 2. best fit
	* fix for bad memory usage: Mutiple free lists for blocks for different sizes
		* Can split theese blocks in bigger list to smaller blocks if needed
			* can also merge two blocks of smaller size
		* speed up: multiple smaller list, and search by size (dont have to start from the bottom of a very large list and search through, but can search and traverse smaller list)
		* **Buddy system**: k lists; the k list has blocks of size $2^k$ or follow fibbonachi system, or .... easier to use $2^k$ as we can just split one block of size $2^k$ and get two blocks of size $2^{k-1}$ 
	* 

_comment_ : pointer to stack top is used so that we know where to start a new activation record


**Static memory allocation**: at compiletime. This is fx the variables (If a variable points to memory which will be dynamicly allocated fx by `malloc()` then the variable is this staticly allocated, but the memory it points to is dynamicly allocated)
**Dynamic memory allocation**: at runtime. I.e recursion, malloc...

Blocks of code has **activation records** which is stored as a stack pointing to the one above it. In this we have variables, results, links... (look slides)
