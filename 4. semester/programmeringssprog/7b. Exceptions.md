# Keywords
## When raising an exception
Delete the activation record we are in (dont need what has just been computed), and invoke exception handler, i.e the catch block needs an activation record, where thing can be called.

## Finally blocks
`finally {}`
Will always get executed, even if it is after the return


# recal
In the activation record we have to store information for the `catch` which we will rarely use, so its better to implement somewhere else where we can store this block, such that we dont store it every activation record for the function.
