When doing overriding, the return-values must be covariant. I.e the extending class overriding a method must return something that also extends the return-value of the on it extends.



# Important
Allowed to have contravariant in the arguments
allowed to have covariance in the return-value

## Covariance
Replace a type with another type, which does not cause problems

## Contravariance

## vTables
vtables: Only have one table for each class, summing up what can do be done via the class. Else we have to store a pointer from a class to another class, which will result in more jumps to know which methods/variables to be used.

LOok at the example for multiple inheritance. Have different offsets to which function or varaibales it should be
Have different paths to which methods/variables should be taken.
In the example A and B has their own tops. THis is a way to implement it.

Have a different offset to which attributes/function should be used.

## Virtual class in C++
`public` means `virtual`

## Fragile classes
If the base class changes, all the extending classes also has to be compiled aswel, since they may also be needing the additional pointers
