When doing overriding, the return-values must be covariant. I.e the extending class overriding a method must return something that also extends the return-value of the on it extends.

# Important
vtables: Only have one table for each class, summing up what can do be done via the class. Else we have to store a pointer from a class to another class, which will result in more jumps to know which methods/variables to be used.
