In java and C++ if overriding the argument has to have the same type, i.e if the superclass has the method which takes in A in the method, then the extending class (the subclass) must also take in an A. But the return value can be covariant. I.e the extending class can return something that is a subclass of what the original function returns, i.e it can return something that extends the class which is returned in the superclass. 

The argument of the redefined method in the subclass, is a supertype of the argument of the
original method.

If this is not the case, we just have overloading and not overriding.



# Important
Allowed to have contravariant in the arguments (the argument has to be a supertype of the original argument)
allowed to have covariance in the return-value (the return value must be a subclass of the original returnvalue)

## Covariance
Replace a type with another type, which does not cause problems

## Contravariance

## vTables
vtables: Only have one table for each class, summing up what can do be done via the class. Else we have to store a pointer from a class to another class, which will result in more jumps to know which methods/variables to be used.

LOok at the example for multiple inheritance. Have different offsets to which function or varaibales it should be
Have different paths to which methods/variables should be taken.
In the example A and B has their own tops. THis is a way to implement it.

Have a different offset to which attributes/function should be used.

## Virtual class in C++
`public` means `virtual`

## Fragile classes
If the base class changes, all the extending classes also has to be compiled aswel, since they may also be needing the additional pointers to the methods
