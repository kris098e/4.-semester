# Types
collections of values
values and operations

# Type systems

# Static or dynamic type checking
static checking at **compilation**
Dynamic checking is at **run-time**

# Categories of types
* scalar types (primitive types)
* composite types (classes)
	* made up of scalar types
* Recursive types
	* type having a field with a type of this type.



# recap
Strongly typed or type inference
Type compatability. I.e can we add a float with an int.
Casting can be done to values, but if the compiler does this for you its called **cohersion**
