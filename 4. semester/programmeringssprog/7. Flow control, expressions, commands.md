# Keywords
* Expression semantics
	* Infix  (as in mathematics)
		* priority
	* prefix (polish)
	* postfix (reverse polish)
	* Also **is the expression evaluated from left to right or right to left**
* effects (side effects of functions can have impact on the expressions)
* evalutation strategies
	* lazy (lazy checks 1 thing at a time, see eager.)
	* eager (evaluate the entire expression even if `a==0 || b/a > 1` eager will evaluate both sides, which may lead to error)
* commands (evaluation that does not necessarily return a value. Possible side effects)
* variables
	* assignment (L-value, R-value, is a side-effect if the assignment doesnt return anything?)
		* assignment operators (++e, e++, --e, e--)
			* can both be for pointer and regular variables
* commands for sequence control (goto, ; ...)
	* structured control commands
		* if-then-else
		* case (e.g switch-statement)
		* iteration (for, while, repeat)
			* unbounded iteration
			* bounded
		* recursion
			* tail recursion (avoid keeping local result, doesnt have to store variables? such that we dont have to store extra variables in activation records)
