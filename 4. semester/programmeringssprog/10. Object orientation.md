# important
overriding works differently than inheritance. Overriding is forever, and when casted to another class, the first method still remains the same

abstract classes
interfaces
Late binding/dynamic lookup

If typecasting an instance of the subclass to the super class, it still uses the variables from the subclass when using the methods on this.

## Encapsulation
Hiding the specific implementation from the user. Hiding information, just need information of what something does

## Multiple inheritance
name clashes

Reuse as much as code as possible
Want to be able to extend multiple classes.

Multiple inheritance isÂ **a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class**. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.

Java does not have this

However can implement two interfaces
## C++
virtual
extending is allowed via using Public-keyword, 

## Subtyping
**subtyping is not the same as inhertiance**
Can use B everywhere that A is needed. If B is a subtype of A

## Late binding
Lookup at runtime which attribute/function to use at runtime via the vtable
